# AStarSearch8Puzzle
This Python program implements the 8-puzzle problem solver using the A search algorithm* with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The goal is to rearrange tiles by sliding them into an empty space ('X') to match the final board configuration using the minimum number of moves.
# How to Use
Run the script:

```sh python3 astarsearch.py ```

The program will output the solution steps if solvable.
